            </a>
            <p style="color:white;">What is it that makes some people excel in leadership roles?
                Leadership theories seek to explain how and why certain people become leaders.
                Such theories often focus on the characteristics of leaders, but some attempt to identify the behaviors
                that people can adopt to improve their own leadership abilities in different situations.</p>

        <p style="color:white;">Prosocial behaviors are those intended to help other people. Prosocial behavior is
            characterized by a concern for the rights, feelings, and welfare of other people.
            Behaviors that can be described as prosocial include feeling empathy and concern for others and behaving
            in ways to help or benefit other people.</p>

            <h4 style="color:white;">SOCIAL COGNITION</h4>
    </a>
    <p style="color:white;">Social cognition is a sub-topic of social psychology that focuses on how people
        process, store, and apply information about other people and social situations.
        It focuses on the role that cognitive processes play in our social interactions. The way we think about
        others plays a major role in how we think, feel,
        and interact with the world around us.

            <h4 style="color:white;">SOCIAL CONTROL AND CULTS.</h4>
    </a>
    <p style="color:white;">The term cult has become, since the latter part of the twentieth century, one of the
        most controversial concepts in the social sciences. The term was originally employed by scholars of
        religion to signify a system of activities centering on an object of worship, but the concept has been
        gradually changed by sociologists to identify a particular
        residual type of religious group that fell outside the boundaries of recognized religious organization.
